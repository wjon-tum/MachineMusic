# Machine Music

This project aims to take .midi files, translate them into a linear timeline of tones and send them to an esp32 board via serial monitor. The esp32 then plays the song using multiple channels.
This is still a work in progress.

Thanks to [Device Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDwMh0pu1iSXeKx7qmqjIQA) for the inspiration!
